# Celebi

* Tasks become worldwide on August 20th
* You can start research on Celebi after you have completed Mew up to Stage 3, then work on the two side by side
* Players from Go Fest will NOT get a second Celebi, we know this has been hot debate for about a month now. They will be receiving “a bounty of” candy to power up their Celebi but can still complete all the special tasks!
* Johto Pokemon are hinted to spawn more often, and there will be field research tasks featuring more Johto Pokemon
