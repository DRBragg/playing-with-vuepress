Pokémon GO Trainers,

Whether you’re seeking a new Pokédex entry or awaiting the arrival of a Lucky Pokémon, you’ll get a chance to enjoy special bonuses starting August 2 at 1:00 P.M. PDT. All trades—including Special Trades—will cost 25% less Stardust to complete! This lasts until August 19 at 9:00 P.M. PDT and applies to all friends, even brand-new ones.

You can earn more Candy during every trade—netting up to six Candies total. Plus, keep an eye out when you encounter a Pokémon not currently in your Pokédex, as you’ll receive triple XP when you gain a new entry!

So, grab your friends and make some memorable trades. Stay safe, and happy exploring!
