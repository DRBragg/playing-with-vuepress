# Niantic Kids, Powered by SuperAwesome, Is Coming to Pokémon GO!
##### August 15, 2018

Good news, Trainers! Children will soon have a new way to log in to Pokémon GO. Niantic Kids, powered by SuperAwesome, is a new log-in platform that will be available to support kid Trainers in Pokémon GO.

Parents can register with Niantic Kids to manage their child’s privacy via the parent portal. Niantic Kids helps you review and approve your child’s permissions before they can play and provides options to control the personal information shared in Pokémon GO. The experience has been developed in conjunction with SuperAwesome’s Kids Web Services, a service certified by ESRB Privacy Certified and by the kidSAFE Seal Program. Niantic Kids gives you peace of mind that your child’s information remains secure while they have fun playing!

If your child currently uses the Pokémon Trainer Club to access Pokémon GO, this log-in will still be supported alongside Niantic Kids and also ensures that your child’s information remains secure. You can continue to enjoy the game with your family in a way that suits you!

We hope you enjoy this new way to enter the world of Pokémon GO!
