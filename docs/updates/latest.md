Pokémon GO Trainers,

As another season of Pokémon’s legendary year comes to a close, a Legendary Pokémon originally discovered in the Hoenn region will emerge—Regirock, which begins its domination of Raid Battles on August 16!

Regirock, the Rock Peak Pokémon, has arrived on the scene and will take over Raid Battles from the Steel-type Legendary Pokémon Registeel until September 20. This Rock-type Legendary Pokémon has a sturdy defense, but it’s weak to Water-, Grass-, Fighting-, Ground-, and Steel-type attacks.

Don’t miss your chance to catch this Legendary Pokémon before it disappears! Stay safe, and happy exploring!
