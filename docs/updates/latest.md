##### August 14, 2018

Pokémon GO Trainers,

Now that the whirlwind Pokémon GO Summer Tour is ending soon with our Pokémon Safari Zone event in Yokosuka, Japan, we’re excited to announce the dates of the next few Community Days happening this year. Mark your calendars for September Community Day, which features the Grass-type Pokémon Chikorita, on Saturday, September 22!

A Grass-type Pokémon originally discovered in the Johto region, Chikorita will appear in the wild for three hours. And if you evolve a Bayleef into Meganium during that three-hour window, your Meganium will know a special move to be announced later. Put those TMs away, Trainers! This move will be available only to Meganium caught or evolved during Community Day. Please see the time for your area below:

Asia-Pacific: 12:00 P.M. to 3:00 P.M. JST (GMT +9)
Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and India: 9:00 A.M. to 12:00 P.M. UTC (GMT +0)
The Americas and Greenland: 11:00 A.M. to 2:00 P.M. PDT (GMT −7)

Plus, you can earn 3× Catch XP throughout the event, supercharging your ability to level up!

Can’t get enough of Community Day? You won’t want to miss the next two exciting events coming up in October and November. On Sunday, October 21, and Saturday, November 10, new Pokémon will be featured, with special bonuses to be announced. Stay tuned for more information in the coming months.

We can’t wait to see you out there, Trainers!
